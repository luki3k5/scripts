## Luki3k5's scripts repo ##

This is the repository for storing all the small scripts that are too tiny to get their own repo

### Organization ###

Each script gets it's own branch, here is the current list of scripts/branches: 

- etc-hosts-adblocker
- google_docs_to_yml

You can read more about what each of them does below

#### etc-hosts-adblocker ####

This script obtains the lists of the ad servers and produces output in 'etc/hosts' 
friendly format so you can add it there to prevent all the browsers on your system 
from ever getting content from these addresses. 

If you would like to know more about etc/hosts and how does it work under each operating system
please follow up on a great article at Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_file)

#### google_docs_to_yml ####

In my career I often deal with i18n files, contacting translators, organizing work with them 
and later assemblin YML file containing the output of everyone's hard work is pain. 
Therefor I took liberty of using awesome googledocs spreedsheets for organizational puproses. 

This simple script obtains the keys and their corresponding translations after that it 
produces yml file for each of the columns (language).
